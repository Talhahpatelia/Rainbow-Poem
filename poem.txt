The Rainbow and the Unicorn and the ponies

The sky so blue,
in the time of a flu.
people screaming on the streets,
for what just some of khans meat.
Oh the pain,
in the house for the 21 ordain.

The sky still so blue,
in the time of a flu.
For a Unicorn he runs,
all the way to the sun.
Run poney run, run.
Yes we are so cool.
